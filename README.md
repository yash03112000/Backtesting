## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm final year undergraduate at IIT Kanpur. I got inspired to build this platform while
using several applications like Zerodha's [Streak](https://www.streak.tech) and [Tradetron](https://tradetron.tech/).

I like solving problems faced in my daily life through my coding skills. Whether its 
- [Minlinks](https://github.com/yash03112000/minlink) - A platform to save and share links in today's world
- [Mafia](https://github.com/yash03112000/mafia) - A online version of popular game to play with friends when we can't play in person due to pandemic

I prefer framing the problem and start working to solve them
Vist my [IITK](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~yashag/) homepage to know more about my work

Feel free to contact me at yashag@iitk.ac.in to discuss more about my and your interest, especially about this platform.

Kindly do suggest me some cool name for this application
